# Electricity-Consumption
The building industry constitutes a substantial share of the global energy consumption landscape and significantly contributes to the overall carbon footprint. Recognizing the potential for environmental stewardship, targeted energy conservation objectives within the building sector hold the promise of tangible reductions in ecological impact. Amid the operational lifecycle of buildings, substantial energy losses arise due to operational inefficiencies and human-related oversights. In a concerted effort to curtail such waste, modern intelligent building systems engage in continuous energy monitoring. In the realm of cutting-edge artificial intelligence, sophisticated machine learning algorithms have evolved to furnish accurate electricity consumption forecasts, reflecting the advancements of our AI-driven era.

## Dataset
This repository contains a real-world electricity demand dataset that was scrapped from the open-source data portal OpenEI. The dataset has been modified to have one-year records of hourly electricity consumption of a hospital building located in Phoenix, USA. The readings are taken in a year from January 1st, to December 31st, starting from 00:00 to 23:00 each day which sums up to a total of 8760 data instances. The data is arranged in a time series manner whereby the power consumption in kilowatt hour (kWh) had been measured in an hour resolution. 

## Exploratory Analysis of Dataset
The exploratory analysis of the dataset indicates two types of seasonality in the data â€“ a daily and weekly pattern that resembles with real world electricity consumption.
